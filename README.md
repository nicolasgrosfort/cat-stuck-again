# Cat stuck again

## Pitch

A game around the feeling of belonging — the team feeling.

The idea was to explore the tension between the individual and the collective action: how each player’s choices shape the identity of the group.
In the game, two characters — a robot and a giraffe — run forward together.

Sometimes they must act in perfect sync to overcome obstacles.
Other times, they face an individual choice, like grabbing a resource when there’s only one available.

The gameplay moves between cooperation and competition — what we call coopetition.
And it’s in this back-and-forth, in these interactions, that the sense of belonging emerges: the collective identity is built as you play.”

## Story

In a world where humanity has lost all empathy, hope seems gone until a strange duo steps in: a curious robot and a tall, gentle giraffe.

Together, they set out on a whimsical mission to rescue cats stuck in trees, for only cats have the power to rekindle empathy in humans.
The giraffe must keep up its strength by eating leaves, while the robot ensures that only cats are being safely caught from the trees.

Each success brings empathy back to the world, but every mistake costs them precious energy.
Their journey is fast, tense, and playful, reminding us that the only way to restore humanity’s empathy is by working together.
